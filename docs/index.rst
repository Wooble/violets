The name
========
In NetHack, a python is represented by a violet (or, ok, purple or magenta
or something...) letter S. "violetS" didn't look as nice.

It's also a tribute to Violets everywhere, whether they're unfortunate
inventors, bratty kids whose love of chewing gum leads to tragedy, or
what have you.
